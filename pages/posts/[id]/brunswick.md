  Valued Guests:


  We can’t possibly convey how grateful we are.  So many of you have emailed or reached out with words of encouragement and support during this time.  Your support is deeply felt and appreciated.  At a time when we are all further apart than we want to be, we feel more encouraged and connected than ever!  We cannot wait to open our doors and host you all again.

  ***Opening:***


  Our Governor has announced steps to re-open New York State. He has devised a three-step process to open shuttered businesses, bring people back to work, and reignite New York’s economy. The plan will hopefully minimize Covid-19 threat to the health and safety of New Yorkers and those traveling to our great State.  Currently the Governor has listed accommodations within Phase 3 of his plan to open New York.  This means we are looking at the end of May, beginning of June.


  ***Changes you will notice:***


  As hospitality professionals, maintaining the health and safety of those staying with us is a top priority. Prior to this pandemic, guests of The Brunswick know that we held ourselves to the highest standards of cleanliness in our guestrooms and common areas.  Going forward, we have taken additional precautions and will ensure we meet and exceed any Federal, State and local guidelines put in place.


  We are committed to ensure our staff is fully aware of all sanitation and hygiene standards.  Our team will be well trained to execute the procedures we will have in place.   Be assured, our practice of deep cleaning and inspections of our property will continue.


  We invite and encourage you to call, prior to booking your stay, with any and all questions or concerns about health and safety protocols you may have.


  All of us at The Brunswick at Saratoga hope that you and your families are safe and healthy and look forward to welcoming you back!
